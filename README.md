# Geometries

This is a repository of geometry files that my group and I use to test our PDE
solvers, mainly [pytential](https://github.com/inducer/pytential) and
[grudge](https://github.com/inducer/grudge).

Many of these geometries were created from scratch in the excellent
[FreeCad](https://www.freecadweb.org/) parametric CAD package.
Where available, I have included the source files so that variants
of the geometry can easily be created.

Once exported in [BRep format](https://www.opencascade.com/doc/occt-6.7.0/overview/html/occt_brep_format.html)
(which I recommend for more reliable operation than either STEP or IGES, at
least with OpenCASCADE-based software), these geometries are suitable for
mesh generation with [gmsh](http://gmsh.info/), from where our solvers
can read the mesh data using [meshmode](https://github.com/inducer/meshmode).
